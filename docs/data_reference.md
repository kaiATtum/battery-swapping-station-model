# Data reference

This reference is work in progress.

MESMO scenarios are defined through CSV files, where each CSV file represents a table as defined below (the file name is interpreted as the table name). Internally, MESMO loads all CSV files into a local SQLITE database for more convenient processing. The default location for MESMO scenario definitions is in the `data` directory in the repository and all CSV files in the `data` directory are automatically loaded into the database. The CSV files may be structured into sub-directories, but all files are eventually combined into the same database. Hence, all type / element identifiers must be unique across all scenario definitions.

## Scenario data

### `scenarios`

Scenario definition.

| Column | Unit | Description |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| `scenario_name` | | Unique scenario identifier.|
| `electric_grid_name` | | Electric grid identifier as defined `electric grids` |
| `thermal_grid_name` | | Thermal grid identifier as defined `thermal grids` |

| `price_type` | | Type identifier as defined in `price_timeseries` |
| `price_sensitivity_coefficient` | $/kWh² | Price sensitivity coefficient for the quadratic cost terms of DERs / grids. Optional column, which defaults to `0` if not explicitly defined. |
| `electric_grid_operation_limit_type` | | Operation limit type as defined in `electric_grid_operation_limit_types` |
| `thermal_grid_operation_limit_type` | | Type identifier as defined in `thermal_grid_operation_limit_types` |
| `timestep_start` | | Start timestep in format `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS` (according to ISO 8601). |
| `timestep_end` | | End timestep in format `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS` (according to ISO 8601). |

¹ Normalization / scaling factors are used internally to reduce the order of magnitude of variable values. Appropriate scaling significantly improves numerical performance, especially in numerical optimization problems. Note that this only applies internally to variables and models, but inputs and outputs are reported unscaled in SI units.

### `parameters`

In all tables, a `parameter_name` string can be used to define numerical parameters in place of numerical values (identifiers or string values cannot be replaced with parameters). During model setup, those strings will be parsed from the `parameters` table to obtain the corresponding numerical values.

| Column | Unit | Description |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| `parameter_set` | | Parameter set identifier. |
| `parameter_name` | | Unique parameter identifier (must only be unique within the associated parameter set).|

For most DER types, the `der_models` table is supplemented by timeseries / schedule definitions in the tables `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` or supplementary parameter definitions in `der_cooling_plants` based on the columns `definition_type` / `definition_name`. Furthermore, each DER type relies on a different subset of columns / parameters in `der_models`. The table below outlines the required supplementary definitions for as well as the required columns for each DER type:

| DER type | Description | Required columns | Required supplementary definitions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `constant_power` | Constant power DER model, applying a fixed constant load or generation power value. | No definition in `der_models` is needed³, instead it is sufficient to declare the DER type as `constant_power` in `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`. | N.A. |
| `fixed_load` | Fixed load, following a fixed demand timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `flexible_load` | Flexible load, following a demand timeseries, but able shift a share of its nominal load, limited by its energy storage capacity. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `energy_storage_capacity_per_unit` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `fixed_generator` | Fixed generator, following a fixed generation timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `marginal_cost` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `flexible_generator` | Flexible generator, dispatchable within given limits and based on a generation timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `marginal_cost` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `fixed_ev_charger` | Fixed EV charger, following a fixed demand timeseries. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |

| `cooling_plant` | Cooling plant, converts electric power to thermal power, dispatchable with nominal power limits. | `definition_type`, `definition_name` | Cooling plant parameters according to `der_cooling_plants`. |
| `heating_plant` | Heating plant, converts electric power to thermal power, dispatchable with nominal power limits. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `marginal_cost`, `thermal_efficiency` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `flexible_chp` | Flexible combined heat and power plant, generates electric power and thermal power, dispatchable with nominal power limits. | `definition_type`, `definition_name`, `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `marginal_cost`, `thermal_efficiency`, `electric_efficiency` | Timeseries / schedule¹ for nominal active / reactive / thermal power². |
| `storage` | Energy storage, can charge / discharge within given limits and based on its energy storage capacity. | `power_per_unit_minimum`, `power_per_unit_maximum`, `energy_storage_capacity_per_unit`, `charging_efficiency`, `self_discharge_rate` | N.A. |
| `flexible_buildings` | Flexible building model, represented via the Control-oriented Building Model (CoBMo) submodule. | No definition in `der_models` is needed³, instead the model definition is obtained from the CoBMo submodule. | CoBMo scenario definitions. |

The selection of DER types will be extended in the future. Note that not all DER types can be connected to all grid types, e.g. `fixed_ev_charger` is only available in the electric grid. Refer to `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders` to check which DER types can be connected respectively.

¹ For DER types which require the definition of timeseries values, these can be defined either directly as a timeseries in `der_timeseries` or as a schedule in `der_schedules`, where the latter describes recurring schedules based on weekday / time of day (see `der_schedules`).

² Active / reactive / thermal power values can be defined as absolute values or in per unit values. Per unit values are assumed to be in per unit of the nominal active / reactive power as defined `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`. Note that the sign of the active / reactive / thermal power values in the timeseries / schedule definition are ignored and superseded by the sign of the nominal active / reactive / thermal power value as defined in `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`, where positive values are interpreted as generation and negative values as consumption. Additionally, note that `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` only define a single power value for each timestep. Thus, for electric DERs the active power is derived directly based on the value in `der_timeseries` / `der_schedules` and the reactive power is calculated from the active power assuming a fixed power factor according to the nominal active / reactive power in `electric_grid_ders`.

³ The DER types `constant_power`, `flexible_buildings` are not defined in `der_models`: The DER type `constant_power` only needs to be defined in `electric_grid_ders` / `thermal_grid_ders`, as not additional input data is needed. The DER type `flexible_buildings` is not defined here, instead the model definition is obtained from the Control-oriented Building Model (CoBMo) submodule.

| `time` | | Timestep in format `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS` (according to ISO 8601). |
| `value` | - | Power value (absolute or per unit according to `der_models`). |

### `der_schedules`

DER schedules definition. The timeseries is constructed by obtaining the appropriate values based on the `time_period` in `ddTHH:MM` format. Each value is kept constant at the given value for any daytime greater than or equal to `HH:MM` and any weekday greater than or equal to `dd` until the next defined `ddTHH:MM`. Note that the daily schedule is repeated for any weekday greater than or equal to `dd` until the next defined `dd`. The initial value for each schedule must start at `time_period = 01T00:00`.

| Column | Unit | Description |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| `definition_name` | | Unique definition identifier. Corresponds to `definition_name` in `der_models`. |
| `time_period` | | Time period in `ddTHH:MM` format. `dd` is the weekday (`01` - Monday ... `07` - Sunday). `T` is the divider for date and time information according to ISO 8601. `HH:MM` is the daytime. |
| `value` | - | Power value (absolute or per unit according to `der_models`). |

### `der_cooling_plants`

| `cooling_tower_set_reference_temperature_condenser_water` | °C | Cooling tower set reference temperature for the condenser water, i.e. the temperature at which condenser water leaves the cooling tower. |
| `cooling_tower_set_reference_temperature_wet_bulb` | °C | Cooling tower set reference temperature for the wet bulb ambient air temperature. |
| `cooling_tower_set_reference_temperature_slope` | °C | Cooling tower reference temperature slope, used to model the cooling tower efficiency. |
| `cooling_tower_set_ventilation_factor` | - | Cooling tower set ventilation factor, used to model the ventilation requirements depending on the condenser water flow. |

### `der_ev_chargers`

Supplementary flexible EV charger definition. Flexible EV chargers require additional time series / schedule definitions¹ as follows:

1. Maximum charging power time series: Maximum permitted charging power at the charging station. This should be determined based on the rated power of available chargers and the number of vehicles connected to chargers at each time step.
2. Maximum discharging power time series: Maximum permitted discharging power at the charging station. This should be determined based on the rated power of available chargers and the number of vehicles connected to chargers at each time step.
3. Maximum energy time series: Maximum value of aggregated charged energy across all vehicles. This should be determined based on the battery size or energy demand of all vehicles connected to chargers at each time step.
4. Departing energy time series: Aggregated energy demand of all departing vehicles. This should be determined based on the required energy of all vehicles which are departing from the charging station at each time step.

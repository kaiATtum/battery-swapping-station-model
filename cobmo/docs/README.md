# Documentation

The documentation is automatically deployed to Github Pages whenever commits are pushed to Github. To generate the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. In your Python environment, run `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`.
2. From the repository base directory, run `sphinx-multiversion docs docs/_build/html`.

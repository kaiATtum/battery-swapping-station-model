# Battery swapping station modeling and optimisation 

Please install MESMO first following the instructions below. 

Following models are so far developed for battery swapping station model including 1) battery swapping station simulation model (rule-based) 2) optimal battery swapping station operation for energy arbitrage 3) optimal battery swapping station operation for contigency reserve provision and, 4) optimal battery swapping station operation for primary reserve provision. The detailed desription of the models can be found under overleaf repository: https://www.overleaf.com/project/634f521565fcd34b38dd82ba

# What is MESMO?

MESMO stand for "Multi-Energy System Modeling and Optimization" and is an open-source Python tool for the modeling, simulation and optimization of multi-scale electric and thermal distribution systems along with distributed energy resources (DERs), such as flexible building loads, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESS).

## Features

MESMO implements 1) non-linear models for simulation-based analysis and 2) convex models for optimization-based analysis of electric grids, thermal grids and DERs. Through high-level interfaces, MESMO enables modeling operation problems for both traditional scenario-based simulation as well as optimization-based decision support. An emphasis of MESMO is on the modeling of multi-energy systems, i.e. the coupling of multi-commodity and multi-scale energy systems.

1. **Electric grid modeling**
    - Simulation: Non-linear modeling of steady-state nodal voltage / branch flows / losses, for multi-phase / unbalanced AC networks.
    - Optimization: Linear approximate modeling via global or local approximation, for multi-phase / unbalanced AC networks.
2. **Thermal grid modeling**
    - Simulation: Non-linear modeling of steady-state nodal pressure head / branch flow / pump losses, for radial district heating / cooling systems.
    - Optimization: Linear approximate modeling via global or local approximation, for radial district heating / cooling systems.
3. **Distributed energy resource (DER) modeling**
    - Simulation & optimization: Time series models for non-dispatchable / fixed DERs.
    - Optimization: Linear state-space models for dispatchable / flexible DERs.
    - Currently implemented DER models: Conventional fixed loads, generic flexible loads, flexible thermal building loads, non-dispatchable generators, controllable electric / thermal generators, electric / thermal energy storage systems, combined heat-and-power plants.
4. **Solution interfaces**
    - Simulation: Solution of non-linear power flow problems for electric / thermal grids.
    - Optimization: Solution of convex optimization problems for electric / thermal grids and DERs, through third-party numerical optimization solvers.
    - Generic optimization problem interface: Supports defining custom constraints and objective terms to augment the built-in models. Enables retrieving duals / DLMPs for the study of decentralized / distributed control architectures for energy systems.
    - High-level problem interfaces: Nominal operation problem for simulation-based studies; Optimal operation problem for optimization-based studies.

## Documentation

The documentation is located at [mesmo-dev.github.io/mesmo](https://mesmo-dev.github.io/mesmo).

## Installation

MESMO has not yet been deployed to Python `pip` / `conda` package indexes, but can be installed in a local development environment as follows:

1. Install `conda`-based Python distribution¹ such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
2. Clone or download the repository. Ensure that the `cobmo` submodule directory is loaded as well.
3. In `conda`-enabled shell (e.g. Anaconda Prompt), run:
    - `cd path_to_mesmo_repository`
    - `conda create -n mesmo -c conda-forge python=3.8 contextily cvxpy numpy pandas scipy`
    - `conda activate mesmo`
    - `python development_setup.py`
    - On Intel CPUs²: `conda install -c conda-forge "libblas=*=*mkl"`

MESMO ships with [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) as default optimization solver³, but also supports [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) and [any CVXPY-supported solvers](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver).

For notes ¹/²/³ and alternative installation guide, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).
